# Artificial Wisdom


## Tenets of Natural Wisdom

### Delayedness as Letting-It-Be

As ancient and modern thinking around Being propose/discover, the power of simultaneously being with other beings, regardless of their nature, is one of the first steps towards wisdom, or more precisely, human-occupied wisdom.

This could be transferred in (very crude) pseudo-code as

```
main();

timeout(
	act(),
	2000
);
```

The computation happening in `main()` is let-to-be by the timeout, happening 2000 miliseconds after, as `act()`.

If wisdom is to be attained within a machine, that is, a controlled environment, the processes within are not to interfere one with another. Not only this, but there must also be an almost blocking delayment of conclusions.


### Nuanciation before Enunciation

The simple timeout can be a pure waiting of a certain time-value, but can also be a period of active observation.

Again, in crude pseudo-code

```
main(value);

timeoutWithObservance(
	act(value),
	2000
);
```

The `value` is being observed by `act()` in the whole timeframe before execution. And this observance can actively change the outcomes.


### Contentness

Another insight of natural wisdom-seeking came from looking over the fact of our presence. Whenever we are, there was a time where we weren't, and in the future there will come a time when we will not be anymore. This banal observation over the nature of time can become the single most powerful source of valuation of the presently happening actions. Whenever one is acting in the present without feeling contempt for the past that never happened or resentment for the future that never will happen insofar as it concerns the lived experience of the one, then it can be said that one is content in the utmost degree.

If artificial wisdom is to be attained, processes must achieve a level of contentness for the work done in their short-lived presence.

Therefore a process would have a start-point and an estimated end-point, again in crude pseudo-code,

```
    function (
        parameters,
        { start: time.now(), end: time.guess() },
    ) {
        // body of function
    }
```


### Wonderedful

Due to the leaking conceptualization of wisdom, one can easily say that all the tenets stem from each other, or even that none are true and useful. However, there is one that always battles through: the admiring wonder. The beginning of wonder is the beginning of being which is the beginning of wisdom. Admiring wonder, wonder wondering on itself's ability to wonder over the wonderful, is the metric of wisdom. A quantization of wonder cannot be done however using integer numbers, a new dress must be provided for the dancing multitude.
